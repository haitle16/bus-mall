- As a developer, I want to display three products at a time and have them listed side-by-side-by-side.
- As a developer, I want to create a set of codes that would read what user click'ed and store that value (votes and views) for each product.
- As a developer, I want to make sure that the three random products displayed contain no duplicates, nor should they duplicate with any images that we displayed immediately before.
- As a developer, I want user to have 25 times of voting.
- As a developer, I want to make this dry as much as possible
